# Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variabltes

You'll want to set your `GOERLI_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in the repo.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `GOERLI_RPC_URL`: This is url of the goerli testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

2. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some tesnet ETH & LINK. You should see the ETH and LINK show up in your metamask. [You can read more on setting up your wallet with LINK.](https://docs.chain.link/docs/deploy-your-first-contract/#install-and-fund-your-metamask-wallet)
